## Attendance-list-sheet

## Overview
This project is a simple web application for managing a list of attendance. Users can input their full name, email address, and class into the form, and the data will be displayed in a table below. Additionally, users can remove entries from the table by clicking on them. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it incorporates the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling.

Entries are displayed in a table format, showing the username, email address, and class.
